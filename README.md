# 🍴 Chipotle Data Analysis Insights

## 1. Profitability
- To identify the **most profitable items**, collect **food costing data** (raw material cost, preparation cost, etc.).
- Helps determine items with **high margins** (high selling price + low cost).

## 2. Combo Strategy
- **Most selling item:** Chicken Bowl  
- **Popular add-ons:** Diet Coke / Coke  
- Create **combo deals** (e.g., Chicken Bowl + Diet Coke) with slightly higher price to:  
  - Increase **Average Order Value (AOV)**  
  - Drive **higher revenue** without discouraging customers

## 3. Promote High-Margin Items
- Once food costing data is available:  
  - Identify **low-cost, high-price items**  
  - Bundle into combos or promote via discounts → improves **overall profit margins**

## 4. Time-Based Trends
- Analyze **time-of-day, day-of-week, and seasonal sales** to:  
  - Forecast sales 📈  
  - Optimize manpower scheduling 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳  
  - Manage inventory and supply chain efficiently 🚚  

## 💡 Additional Suggestions
- **Customer Segmentation:** Analyze purchase behavior for loyalty programs.  
- **Menu Engineering:** Classify items as:  
  - ⭐ Stars: High profit, high sales  
  - 💤 Sleepers: Low sales, low profit  
  - 🚀 Opportunities: Low cost, high margin, under-promoted  
- **Cross-Selling:** Suggest add-ons (chips, salsa, toppings) for high-demand items.  
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Slightly increase prices during peak hours (if acceptable).  
- **Customer Feedback Integration:** Promote items that are both **profitable** and **well-liked**.
